# K-Mean-Clustering-Project

# AIM:

A mall has collected information about their client and given them spending score (1-100) on the basis of their spending, visit
frequency, annual income, and age. The client has asked to categorize their clients into group so that they can target better.

# Data Set:


# Approach:

 It is a unlabelled data set and Clearly we donâ€™t know how many clusters could be? It becomes a clustering problem. WE used K-Mean clustering algorithm to find the number of the clusters. We used Elbow method to find visually how many clusters could be?
 
 # Result:
