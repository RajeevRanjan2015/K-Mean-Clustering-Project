# Clustering-Project

To find the clusters or groups existing the data set which is unlabelled so that the mall client can target their loyal customers better with their liked products in a better way.


## AIM:

A mall has collected information about their client and given them spending score (1-100) on the basis of their spending, visit
frequency, annual income, and age. The client has asked to categorize their clients into group so that they can target better.
To measure accuracy achieved with applying K-Mean, Agglomarative Clustering and see which will perform better?

## Data Set:

THe data set is called Mall_Customers.csv given by the client having 200 records, a very small data set which is to be used as POC project. The real data set we can't publish or talk about like this. The data set has CustomerID,	Genre,	Age,	Annual Income (k$), and 	Spending Score (1-100).


## Approach:

 It is a unlabelled data set and Clearly we donâ€™t know how many clusters could be? It becomes a clustering problem. WE used K-Mean clustering algorithm to find the number of the clusters. We used Elbow method to find visually how many clusters could be?
 
 ## Result:
 
The are total of 5 clusters we are able to extract from the data set. The process based on the Elbow method and WCSS=Within cluster sum of square parameter to decide the number of clusters we can have.
